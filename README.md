**Version 1.1.1**

A ring modulator audio plugin built with [JUCE](https://juce.com/). Multiplies the input signal by a selectable carrier waveform to produce classic ring modulation sidebands, with a dry/wet mix control.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Carrier Frequency | 20 – 2000 Hz | 440 Hz | Frequency of the carrier oscillator (log-scaled) |
| Dry/Wet Mix | 0 – 1 | 1.0 | 0 = dry input only, 1 = fully ring-modulated output |
| Waveform | Sine / Saw / Square / Triangle | Sine | Shape of the carrier oscillator |

## How It Works

Ring modulation multiplies the input signal by a carrier waveform:

```
output = dry + mix * (input × carrier − dry)
```

This creates sum and difference sidebands around the carrier frequency, producing metallic, bell-like, or robotic timbres depending on the carrier frequency, waveform, and input material.

### Waveform character

| Waveform | Character |
|---|---|
| Sine | Clean sidebands — classic ring mod sound |
| Saw | Dense harmonic stack; brighter and more aggressive |
| Square | Odd harmonics only; hollow, nasal timbre |
| Triangle | Softer than square; gentle odd-harmonic colour |

> **Note:** Saw and Square carriers contain harmonics above Nyquist that will alias at high carrier frequencies. This is an intentional DSP characteristic and adds to the character of those modes.

## 30 Hz UI Timer

The oscilloscope display is driven by a 30 Hz `juce::Timer` running on the message thread. It exists to solve a fundamental threading constraint in audio plug-ins.

### The problem: two threads, no shared locks

`processBlock()` runs on the **audio thread** at real-time priority — it must never be blocked, stalled, or synchronised with a mutex. The **UI (message) thread** needs to display what the carrier oscillator is doing, but reading audio data from the UI thread directly would be a data race.

### Solution: lock-free FIFO

`processBlock()` pushes carrier samples into a `juce::AbstractFifo`-backed ring buffer (`scopeRing`) on the audio thread. Every ~33 ms the timer pulls those samples out into the local `displayBuf` snapshot on the message thread. `AbstractFifo` is designed for exactly this one-producer / one-consumer pattern — no mutex needed.

```
Audio thread                   Message thread (30 Hz)
─────────────────              ──────────────────────────────
processBlock()                 timerCallback()
  │                              │
  ├─ generate carrier            ├─ drainScopeData() ──► shift displayBuf left
  └─ push to scopeRing (FIFO)    │                        append new samples
                                 └─ repaint() ──► paint() reads displayBuf
```

The rolling window is maintained by a shift-left / append-right `memmove` + `memcpy` strategy, so the oscilloscope always shows the most recent 512 carrier samples regardless of the host buffer size.

### Why 30 Hz?

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Smooth enough** | 30 fps is perceptually fluid for a waveform display |
| **FIFO won't overflow** | The FIFO holds ~185 ms at 44 100 Hz (`kScopeFifoSize = 8192`). At 30 Hz the timer drains every ~33 ms — well within budget |
| **CPU headroom** | 60 Hz would double repaint cost for little visible gain on a slowly-changing oscilloscope |

## Building

### Requirements

- CMake 3.22+
- A C++17 compiler (MSVC 2022, Clang, or GCC)
- Git (JUCE 8.0.13 is fetched automatically if no local copy is provided)

### Configure and Build

```bash
# JUCE is downloaded automatically via FetchContent
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

To use a local JUCE tree instead (faster, avoids the download):

```bash
cmake -B build -DJUCE_PATH="/path/to/JUCE"
cmake --build build --config Release
```

The built plugin will be placed in `build/RingMod_artefacts/Release/`.

Supported formats: **VST3**, **Standalone**.

### Installing into a DAW

Copy `build/RingMod_artefacts/Release/VST3/RingMod.vst3` to:

| OS | Default VST3 folder |
|---|---|
| Windows | `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\` |
| macOS | `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/` |

**Auto-install after build** (Windows, requires admin shell):

```bash
cmake -B build -DJUCE_PATH="..." -DCOPY_PLUGIN=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
```

**MSI installer** — download `RingMod-v1.1.1-win64.msi` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kv244/RingModulator/releases) for a one-click install to the system VST3 folder.

#### Ableton Live
Preferences → Plug-Ins → enable "Use VST3 Plug-In Custom Folder" or point it at the Common Files path above. Re-scan plug-ins after copying.

#### Renoise
Preferences → Plug-Ins/Devices → add the VST3 folder and click Re-scan. The plugin supports both mono and stereo FX tracks.

A self-contained example project is included at [`examples/sample_ringMod.xrns`](examples/sample_ringMod.xrns) — open it directly in Renoise 3.5+ to hear the plugin in use (square wave bass, 342 Hz carrier, 29% wet mix).

## Changelog

### 1.1.1
- Reworked the GUI to match the Futuristic Audio Filter Figma reference: synced mix progress-bar, footer status bar with parameter pips, corner accents, scanline overlay, and richer background glow
- Fixed CI: dropped the pinned CMake Visual Studio generator so builds auto-detect the toolset actually installed on the runner image

### 1.1.0
- Added **Waveform** parameter: Sine, Saw, Square, Triangle carrier shapes
- Replaced `juce::dsp::Oscillator` with a direct phase accumulator for allocation-free waveform switching on the audio thread
- Waveform switches only at phase zero-crossing to avoid mid-cycle discontinuities
- Added `isBusesLayoutSupported` — plugin now accepts mono and stereo FX tracks (Ableton Live, Renoise)
- Added `processBlockBypassed` for click-free DAW bypass
- Added WiX v4 MSI installer; releases published automatically to GitHub Releases on version tags

### 1.0.0
- Initial release: sine carrier ring modulator, dry/wet mix, oscilloscope, custom knob UI
